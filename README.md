# Password-Generator
So one night, I decided to sit down and do some Python - to begin to build up a library of Python projects, I decided to revisist something very easy - a password generator.
I decided to try and make a password generator where you can choose if you want a simplistic, easy to remember password or a hard to remember yet secure password. When you
answer the question to which type of password you want, there are only four <b>valid</b> answers that you can write down, which are:

<b>"noteable"</b>
<b>"noteable password</b>
<b>"secure"</b>
<b>"secure password"</b>

These are <b>not</b> capital sensitive, so you may capitilize them however you want; though these are sensitive to spelling mistakes. In the future, I may make a version of 
this with user interface instead of the typical console application. I hope I delved into enough detail about this project for now in this readme. Its unlikely I will update
this often, though I will if I think I can make the code more efficient (which it is not right now) or if I discover a major flaw. In the mean time, I will instead be working
on other projects to upload to my github. If you use this, then hopefully it proves useful - if you find any issues, just drop them inside the issues tab and I will inspect it.
